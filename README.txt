# HotSpot Communities in Cancers

This integrated workflow identifies mutational hotspot communities on protein structure to predict cancer drivers.

This workflow has three main steps : 

1) Mapping of SNPs onto 3D -structure of proteins

2) Identification of communities on protein 3D-strcutures

3) Identification of hotspot communities on protein structure


** Reource Datasets folder consists of hotspot communities identified by running HotCommics workflow on TCGA Pan-Cancer atlas project **
